Usage:

    self:init
        Initializes the current directory with an ash_modules file

    self:install [$git_url] [--global]
        Installs the modules defined in the ash_modules file.

        If `$git_url` is passed, only that ash module will be
        downloaded.

        The `--global` flag may only be passed if `$git_url` is
        also passed.  Adding the `--global` flag will install
        the single module globally, which will allow access to
        the module from any directory.
